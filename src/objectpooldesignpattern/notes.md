- A creation design pattern
- Manages pool of reusable object like db connection pool
- Borrows from the pool, uses it and returns it when done
- Reduces overhead of creating and destroying frequently used objects
- Reduces latency but using already created object
- prevents resource exhaustion by managing the number of object creation
- Should be used with singleton design pattern and requires thread safety when acquiring and releasing resource
